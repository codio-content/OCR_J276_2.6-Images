The file size in bits can be calculated using the following formula:

$$W \times H \times D$$

Where ‘W’ is width, ‘H’ is height and ‘D’ is the colour depth used.

Therefor the file size of the larger 24 bit image image = 3288 * 3168 * 24 bits
= 249,993,216 bits
= 249,993,216 / 8 = 31,249,152 bytes
= 31,249,152 / 1000 = 31,249.1 kilobytes
= 31.2 megabytes
