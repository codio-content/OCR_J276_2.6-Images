Computers represent and store images as binary.

A digital image is composed of many small points of colour called picture elements or **pixels**, for short. Each pixel is represented by a number of bits. Programs can indicate where each pixel is placed on the screen and what colour it is to be.
A pixel is the smallest possible dot in an image or on a computer screen which can have its colour set independently.

The size of the image is given as the number of pixels in the width and then the number of pixels in the height, for example 640 x 480 or 2048 x 1536.

Here are two versions of the same image but of different sizes.

One image consists of 3288 * 3168 = 10,416,384 pixels and the other of 100 * 96 = 9,600 pixels.


If both images are enlarged to the same size on the page the difference between them can be seen.

When the smaller image is enlarged it is less clear as it has a much lower **resolution** â€“ there are less pixels per square inch than for the larger image as its pixels have now been spread over a larger area.
