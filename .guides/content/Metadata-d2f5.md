Metadata is ‘data about data’. 

It is included in many files, in addition to the stored data. For example in a Microsoft Word document there is information about the person who created the file and when it was created and last saved.

The metadata included in a digital image file contains technical and descriptive information and it is stored in a format called Exif which stands for Exchangeable image file format. 

The following shows some of the metadata displayed for an image.

It can include items such as:

- make and model number of the camera
- aperture setting
- speed settings
- dimensions of the image and the file size
- The metadata can also store the location where the image was taken if the camera has GPS facilities or the user can edit the data to add it

The user can insert other descriptive data such as:

- captions
- headlines
- titles
- the names of people in the image
