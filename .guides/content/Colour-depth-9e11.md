The colour depth is the number of bits used to encode the colour of each pixel.
It important for the quality of the colours in an image as the greater number of bits used then the more colours can be differentiated.

In a black and white image (2 colours) only 1 bit is needed – if it is set to 0 then the pixel will be black and it will be white if set to 1.
If 2 bits are used for each pixel, then 4 colours can be represented and eight colours if 3 bits are used.
These can be represented by powers of two.

This number of bits produces such a realistic image it is described as being ‘true colour’.

As it would be laborious to have to enter 24 bit binary numbers to indicate the colour required for a pixel, hexadecimal numbers are used. (See lesson 4).
